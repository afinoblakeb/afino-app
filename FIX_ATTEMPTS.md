# Supabase Authentication Fix Attempts

## Issue Summary
We're experiencing authentication issues with Supabase in our Next.js 15.2.1 application. The main problems are:

1. PKCE Code Exchange Error: `invalid request: both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty`
2. Session not established before redirect
3. Middleware interference with the authentication flow
4. New error: Synchronous use of `cookies()` API in Next.js 15.2.1

## Fix Attempt #1

### Changes Made:
1. Updated middleware to use `createMiddlewareClient` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`
2. Improved the callback route to use server-side code exchange
3. Enhanced the SignInForm to support the `next` parameter
4. Simplified the AuthProvider to avoid conflicts with middleware

### Error Encountered:
```
Error: Route "/auth/callback" used `cookies().get('sb-sjclvcrtuqtdwtupizxd-auth-token')`. `cookies()` should be awaited before using its value. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis
```

## Fix Attempt #2

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the callback route to use the cookies API asynchronously:
   - Changed `cookies: () => cookieStore` to `cookies: async () => cookieStore`
   - Added more robust error handling and session verification

2. Added comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow:
   - Added detailed logs in the callback route
   - Added detailed logs in the middleware
   - Added detailed logs in the SignInForm component
   - Added detailed logs in the AuthProvider

3. Fixed linter errors and improved code quality

### Error Encountered:
```
TypeError: nextCookies.get is not a function
    at getItemAsync (../../../src/lib/helpers.ts:127:30)
    at SupabaseAuthClient._exchangeCodeForSession (../../src/GoTrueClient.ts:599:43)
```

This error indicates that the cookies API in Next.js 15.2.1 has changed, and the Supabase client is trying to use a method that doesn't exist on the cookies object.

## Fix Attempt #3

### Changes Made:
1. Completely redesigned the callback route:
   - Removed dependency on `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` for the callback route
   - Used the direct `@supabase/supabase-js` client instead
   - Set `detectSessionInUrl: true` to automatically handle the code in the URL
   - Added a fallback HTML page with client-side code for session establishment

2. Identified package versions:
   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`: 0.10.0
   - `@supabase/ssr`: 0.5.2
   - `@supabase/supabase-js`: 2.49.1

### Error Encountered:
```
[Auth Callback] No session established
GET /auth/signin?error=Authentication%20failed 200 in 71ms
```

The session was not established even with our hybrid approach. This suggests that the code verifier stored during the initial auth request is not being properly accessed during the code exchange.

## Fix Attempt #4

### Changes Made:
1. Switched to a 100% client-side approach for the callback route:
   - Simplified the callback to just return a lightweight HTML page
   - Let the browser handle the entire code exchange process
   - Added detailed localStorage logging for debugging
   - Set up special flags to indicate this is a post-auth redirect

2. Enhanced the middleware to handle post-auth redirects:
   - Added logic to detect post-auth redirects via a cookie and URL parameter
   - Implemented a grace period for dashboard access after authentication
   - Added client-side code to check for session establishment
   - Prevents redirect loops by allowing temporary access to protected routes

3. Improved the SignInForm:
   - Cleaned up local storage before auth to ensure a fresh start
   - Added detailed logging of localStorage before and after the auth request
   - Made sure the PKCE flow is properly configured

### Error Encountered:
```
[Middleware] Post-auth redirect to dashboard without session, allowing through temporarily
[Middleware] Processing request for path: /auth/signin
```

The session was still not being established properly, and users were being redirected back to the sign-in page after the grace period.

## Fix Attempt #5 (Current)

### Changes Made:
1. **Stopped clearing localStorage before authentication**:
   - Removed the line `localStorage.removeItem('supabase.auth.token')` from SignInForm
   - This was likely removing the code verifier needed for the PKCE flow

### Rationale:
The PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow requires a code verifier that is:
1. Generated on the client during the initial authentication request
2. Stored in localStorage by Supabase
3. Retrieved during the code exchange to validate the authorization code

By clearing localStorage before initiating the sign-in process, we were inadvertently removing any existing code verifiers, breaking the PKCE flow. Without the code verifier, the authorization code exchange would fail with the error: `invalid request: both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty`.

### Next Steps:
1. Test the authentication flow with this change
2. If this doesn't resolve the issue, we'll try upgrading the Supabase packages to ensure compatibility with Next.js 15.2.1

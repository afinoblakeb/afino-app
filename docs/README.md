## Documentation Guidelines

When adding new documentation:

1. Place it in the appropriate subdirectory based on its content
2. Use Markdown format for all documentation
3. Include a clear title and description at the top of each document
4. Use relative links when referencing other documentation files
5. Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves

## Legacy Documentation

Previously, documentation was split between `./docs` and `./project-docs/docs`. All documentation has now been consolidated into this single location for better organization and discoverability.

# Next Steps After React Query Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented React Query as a solution to the infinite API calls and page reloads issue in the Afino application. This document outlines the next steps to further enhance the application's performance, reliability, and user experience.

## Completed Work

- [x] Installed React Query and set up infrastructure
- [x] Created custom hooks for data fetching (useUserProfile, useOrganizations)
- [x] Refactored components to use React Query:
  - [x] MainLayout
  - [x] AuthProvider
  - [x] profile-client
  - [x] organizations-client
- [x] Created comprehensive tests for React Query implementation
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Next Steps

### 1. HTTP Caching Improvements

- [ ] Add proper Cache-Control headers to API routes:
  - [ ] `/api/users/me`
  - [ ] `/api/users/me/organizations`
  - [ ] Other frequently accessed routes
- [ ] Implement conditional requests (ETag/If-None-Match or Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since)
- [ ] Add stale-while-revalidate cache policy

Example API route improvement:

```javascript
// In API route handler
export async function GET(request) {
  // ... fetch data logic
  
  return NextResponse.json(data, {
    headers: {
      'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=3600',
      'ETag': computeETag(data), // Generate an ETag based on data
    }
  });
}
```

### 2. Additional React Query Features

- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for mutations
- [ ] Add prefetching for anticipated user navigation
- [ ] Set up query invalidation for related queries
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed queries

Example optimistic update:

```javascript
const useSaveProfile = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation(
    (newProfile) => saveProfileToAPI(newProfile),
    {
      // Optimistically update UI
      onMutate: async (newProfile) => {
        // Cancel outgoing refetches
        await queryClient.cancelQueries(['profile']);
        
        // Save previous value
        const previousProfile = queryClient.getQueryData(['profile']);
        
        // Update cache with new value immediately
        queryClient.setQueryData(['profile'], newProfile);
        
        return { previousProfile };
      },
      
      // If the mutation fails, roll back
      onError: (err, newProfile, context) => {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['profile'], context.previousProfile);
        toast.error('Failed to save profile');
      },
      
      // Always refetch after mutation
      onSettled: () => {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(['profile']);
      },
    }
  );
};
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Set up real-time monitoring for API calls
- [ ] Implement client-side performance tracking
- [ ] Create dashboards to visualize API usage and performance
- [ ] Set up alerts for unusual API call patterns

### 4. User Experience Improvements

- [ ] Add skeleton loaders while data is being fetched
- [ ] Implement better error handling with retry options
- [ ] Add offline support for critical operations
- [ ] Improve loading states and transitions

Example skeleton loader:

```jsx
function ProfilePage() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useUserProfile();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <ProfileSkeleton />
      ) : error ? (
        <ErrorDisplay error={error} onRetry={() => refetch()} />
      ) : (
        <ProfileDisplay data={data} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Code Quality and Documentation

- [ ] Create more examples for using React Query in the codebase
- [ ] Update API documentation to include caching behavior
- [ ] Add code comments explaining the React Query implementation
- [ ] Create a style guide for data fetching

### 6. Testing Expansion

- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for React Query usage
- [ ] Create integration tests for the full data flow
- [ ] Set up performance tests to ensure API calls are minimized
- [ ] Add tests for error scenarios and recovery

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Implement HTTP caching improvements
2. **Week 2**: Add additional React Query features
3. **Week 3**: Set up performance monitoring
4. **Week 4**: Implement user experience improvements
5. **Week 5**: Update documentation and code quality
6. **Week 6**: Expand test coverage

## Expected Outcomes

- **Performance**: Reduced server load and faster page loads
- **Reliability**: Fewer errors and better recovery from failures
- **User Experience**: Smoother transitions and better feedback
- **Maintainability**: Clearer code patterns and better documentation
- **Scalability**: More efficient resource usage for future growth

## Conclusion

The implementation of React Query has resolved the immediate issue of infinite API calls and page reloads. The next steps outlined above will further enhance the application's performance, reliability, and user experience. By implementing these improvements, we will create a more robust and scalable application that provides a better experience for users and is easier to maintain for developers.

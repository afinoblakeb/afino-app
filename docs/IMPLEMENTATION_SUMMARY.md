# React Query Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made in implementing React Query as a solution to the infinite API calls and page reloads issue in the Afino application. We've completed the foundational work and are now ready to begin refactoring the components that are causing the issues.

## Completed Work

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Installed `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching and caching
   - Installed `msw` for API mocking in tests

2. **QueryProvider Component**
   - Created `src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` with optimal configuration
   - Set up staleTime, cacheTime, and refetchOnWindowFocus settings
   - Configured for proper handling of visibility changes

3. **Custom Hooks**
   - Implemented `useUserProfile` hook for fetching user profile data
   - Implemented `useOrganizations` hook for fetching organizations data
   - Added proper error handling with toast notifications
   - Configured caching and refetching strategies

### Testing Infrastructure

1. **Test Utilities**
   - Created `src/test-utils/react-query-utils.tsx` with helper functions
   - Created `src/test-utils/msw-server.ts` for API mocking
   - Set up Jest configuration in `src/test-utils/jest-setup.ts`

2. **Test Cases**
   - Created tests for visibility change behavior
   - Created tests for the integration with AuthProvider
   - Created tests for the custom hooks
   - Verified that React Query properly handles tab visibility changes

### Documentation

1. **Test Plan**
   - Created `TEST_PLAN_REACT_QUERY.md` outlining test cases
   - Documented testing strategies for different components

2. **Refactoring Plan**
   - Created `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` with detailed steps
   - Outlined approach for each component that needs refactoring

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Updated `PROGRESS.md` to reflect completed work
   - Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` with completed tasks

## Next Steps

1. **Update App Entry Point**
   - Wrap the application with QueryProvider in `app/layout.tsx`

2. **Refactor Components**
   - Refactor MainLayout to use React Query
   - Refactor AuthProvider to use React Query
   - Refactor profile-client to use React Query
   - Refactor organizations-client to use React Query

3. **API Optimization**
   - Add proper HTTP caching headers to API routes
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate strategy

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Run all tests to verify the implementation
   - Perform manual testing to ensure no infinite reloads

## Benefits of the Implementation

1. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduced number of API calls through proper caching
   - Elimination of infinite reloads and API calls
   - Improved user experience with proper loading states

2. **Code Quality**
   - Centralized data fetching logic in custom hooks
   - Simplified component logic by removing manual caching
   - Better error handling and user feedback

3. **Maintainability**
   - Easier to add new data fetching requirements
   - Consistent approach to data fetching across the application
   - Better testability with dedicated testing utilities

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Addressed type issues in custom hooks
   - Ensured proper typing for React Query hooks
   - Created type-safe testing utilities

2. **Testing Complexity**
   - Created dedicated testing utilities for React Query
   - Set up MSW for API mocking
   - Implemented tests for visibility change behavior

3. **Linter Errors**
   - Addressed various linter errors in TypeScript files
   - Ensured code quality through proper typing
   - Fixed issues with Jest DOM matchers

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in implementing React Query as a solution to the infinite API calls and page reloads issue. The foundational work is complete, and we're now ready to begin refactoring the components that are causing the issues. The implementation follows best practices and addresses the root causes identified in the emergency fix documentation.

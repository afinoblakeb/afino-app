# Authentication Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the work done on the authentication flow for the Afino platform, the issues encountered, and the current state of the implementation.

## Initial Implementation

The initial authentication implementation used Supabase Auth with the following components:

1. **SignInForm Component**: A form that allows users to sign in with email/password or Google OAuth
2. **AuthProvider**: A context provider that manages authentication state across the app
3. **Middleware**: A Next.js middleware that protects routes based on authentication status
4. **Callback Route**: A route handler for OAuth callbacks

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: No Redirect After Authentication

**Problem**: After successful authentication with Google, users were not being redirected to the dashboard.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Updated the callback route to handle the OAuth code exchange
2. Modified the middleware to allow the callback route to proceed
3. Enhanced the SignInForm to better handle the authentication flow

### Issue 2: "No code provided" Error

**Problem**: After Google authentication, users were redirected to the sign-in page with a "No code provided" error.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
Supabase was using the implicit OAuth flow (with hash fragments like `#access_token=...`), but our code was expecting the authorization code flow (with a `code` query parameter).

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Updated the authentication flow to handle both authorization code and implicit flows
2. Added detection for hash fragments with access tokens
3. Modified the middleware to handle URLs with hash fragments

## Current Implementation

### Authentication Flow Components

1. **Supabase Client Setup**:
   - `supabase-browser.ts`: Client-side Supabase client
   - `supabase-server.ts`: Server-side Supabase client
   - `supabase.ts`: Re-exports the browser client for backward compatibility

2. **SignInForm Component**:
   - Handles both email/password and Google OAuth authentication
   - Includes client-side detection for hash fragments with access tokens
   - Uses Suspense boundary for proper handling of client-side hooks

3. **Middleware**:
   - Protects routes based on authentication status
   - Handles special cases for the callback route and hash fragments
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page

4. **Callback Route**:
   - Handles both authorization code and implicit flows
   - Exchanges OAuth codes for sessions
   - Redirects users to the dashboard after successful authentication

### Current Issues

Despite multiple attempts to fix the authentication flow, users are still not being redirected to the dashboard after successful Google authentication. The flow has become increasingly complex with each attempted fix, potentially making it harder to diagnose and resolve the core issue.

## Recommendations

1. **Simplify the Authentication Flow**:
   - Consider a more straightforward approach to authentication
   - Reduce the number of components involved in the flow
   - Focus on a single authentication method (either authorization code or implicit flow)

2. **Investigate Supabase Configuration**:
   - Review the Supabase project settings to ensure they match our implementation
   - Consider using Supabase's recommended authentication patterns

3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**:
   - Implement a simpler authentication flow using Supabase's client-side libraries
   - Use Supabase's pre-built authentication UI components
   - Consider a different authentication provider if Supabase continues to cause issues

## Next Steps

Before proceeding with further changes, a thorough review of the current implementation is recommended to identify the core issues and determine the best path forward.

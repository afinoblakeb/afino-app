# Afino Platform Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Afino platform, providing a structured approach to building the core scaffolding features.

## Overview

The implementation will follow a feature-driven development approach, with each feature being implemented in a complete vertical slice (UI, API, database). We'll prioritize the core scaffolding features that enable basic platform functionality, focusing on authentication, organization management, user management, and role-based access control.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication (Estimated: 3-4 days)

1. **Sign-Up Page** (1-2 days)
   - Implement sign-up form with validation
   - Connect to Supabase Auth
   - Create user in Prisma database
   - Implement email verification flow
   - Add success/error handling

2. **Sign-In Page** (1 day)
   - Implement sign-in form with validation
   - Connect to Supabase Auth
   - Add remember me functionality
   - Add success/error handling

3. **Password Reset Flow** (1 day)
   - Implement request password reset page
   - Implement reset password page
   - Connect to Supabase Auth password reset
   - Add success/error handling

### Phase 2: Organization Management (Estimated: 4-5 days)

1. **Create Organization** (1-2 days)
   - Implement organization creation form
   - Add slug generation and validation
   - Set up logo upload with Supabase Storage
   - Create organization in database
   - Create default roles
   - Assign creator as admin

2. **Organization Settings** (1 day)
   - Implement organization details update
   - Add organization deletion with confirmation
   - Add success/error handling

3. **User Invitation Flow** (2 days)
   - Implement invitation form with role selection
   - Create invitation tokens and store in database
   - Set up email delivery for invitations
   - Implement invitation acceptance page
   - Handle new vs. existing user scenarios
   - Add success/error handling

### Phase 3: User Management (Estimated: 3-4 days)

1. **User Profile** (1-2 days)
   - Implement profile information display
   - Add profile update form
   - Set up avatar upload with Supabase Storage
   - Implement password change functionality
   - Add success/error handling

2. **Role Management** (2 days)
   - Implement role listing interface
   - Add role creation and editing forms
   - Create permission selection interface
   - Implement role deletion with validation
   - Add member role assignment
   - Add success/error handling

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (Estimated: 3-4 days)

1. **Unit Testing** (1-2 days)
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Write unit tests for utility functions
   - Write unit tests for form validation

2. **Integration Testing** (1-2 days)
   - Write integration tests for authentication flows
   - Write integration tests for organization management
   - Write integration tests for user management

3. **UI Refinement** (1 day)
   - Improve responsive design
   - Enhance accessibility
   - Add loading states and animations
   - Refine error messages and notifications

### Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment (Estimated: 2-3 days)

1. **Documentation** (1-2 days)
   - Create API documentation
   - Document components
   - Write user guide
   - Update developer documentation

2. **Deployment Setup** (1 day)
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up staging environment
   - Configure production environment
   - Set up monitoring and logging

## Development Approach

### Code Organization

- **Feature-based structure**: Organize code by feature rather than by technical layer
- **Shared components**: Extract common UI components to a shared directory
- **API routes**: Organize API routes by resource
- **Database access**: Use Prisma Client for all database operations

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning**:
   - Review and refine feature plan
   - Break down into tasks
   - Estimate effort

2. **Implementation**:
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement UI components
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Connect to database
   - Add tests

3. **Review and Refinement**:
   - Code review
   - Address feedback
   - Refine implementation
   - Ensure test coverage

4. **Integration**:
   - Merge to main branch
   - Verify integration
   - Update documentation
   - Update progress tracking

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Next.js 15.2.1 with App Router
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Supabase (Auth, Storage)
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- Jest and React Testing Library
- React Hook Form
- Zod for validation

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Authentication complexity**: Integrating Supabase Auth with custom user management
   - Mitigation: Start with authentication implementation to address early

2. **Database schema changes**: Need for schema modifications during development
   - Mitigation: Use Prisma migrations for controlled schema evolution

3. **UI/UX consistency**: Maintaining consistent design across features
   - Mitigation: Establish component library and design system early

4. **Performance issues**: Potential bottlenecks with complex queries
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination and optimize database queries

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can sign up, sign in, and manage their profile
2. Users can create organizations and invite other users
3. Organization admins can manage roles and permissions
4. The application is responsive, accessible, and performant
5. All core features have test coverage
6. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of authentication features
2. Set up testing infrastructure
3. Refine UI components and design system
4. Implement organization creation flow

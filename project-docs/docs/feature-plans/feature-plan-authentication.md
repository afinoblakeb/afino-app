# Feature Plan: Authentication

## Overview

This feature implements the authentication flow for the Afino platform, including sign-up, sign-in, and password reset functionality. It leverages Supabase Auth for secure authentication and integrates with our Prisma database schema.

## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access the platform
- As a returning user, I want to sign in to my account so that I can access my data
- As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it so that I can regain access to my account
- As a user, I want to verify my email address so that my account is secure

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- User registration with email and password
- Email verification for new accounts
- User sign-in with email and password
- Password reset functionality
- Remember me functionality for persistent sessions
- Form validation for all inputs
- Error handling for authentication failures
- Redirect to dashboard after successful authentication
- Protected routes that require authentication

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Secure password storage (handled by Supabase)
- Fast authentication response times
- Responsive design for all authentication pages
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Cross-browser compatibility

## UI/UX Design

- Clean, minimal authentication forms
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Loading states during authentication processes
- Success messages for completed actions
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- `SignUpForm`: Form component for user registration
- `SignInForm`: Form component for user login
- `PasswordResetRequestForm`: Form to request password reset
- `PasswordResetForm`: Form to set a new password
- `EmailVerificationMessage`: Component to display email verification status
- `AuthLayout`: Layout component for authentication pages

### Database Changes

No additional database changes are required as the User model is already defined in our Prisma schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id           String         @id @default(uuid())
  email        String         @unique
  fullName     String         @map("full_name")
  avatarUrl    String?        @map("avatar_url")
  phoneNumber  String?        @map("phone_number")
  createdAt    DateTime       @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt    DateTime       @updatedAt @map("updated_at")
  
  // Relations
  profile      UserProfile?
  members      Member[]
  invitations  Invitation[]   @relation("InvitedBy")

  @@map("users")
}
```

### API Endpoints

We'll use Supabase Auth API endpoints:

- `POST /auth/v1/signup`: Register a new user
- `POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=password`: Sign in a user
- `POST /auth/v1/recover`: Request password reset
- `PUT /auth/v1/user`: Update user password
- `GET /auth/v1/verify`: Verify email address

### Authentication/Authorization

- Use Supabase Auth for authentication
- Create an auth context to manage authentication state
- Implement protected routes using Next.js middleware
- Store JWT tokens securely in cookies or localStorage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test form validation logic
- Test form submission handlers
- Test error handling
- Test auth context provider

### Integration Tests

- Test sign-up flow
- Test sign-in flow
- Test password reset flow
- Test email verification flow

### End-to-End Tests

- Complete sign-up process
- Complete sign-in process
- Complete password reset process
- Test protected routes

## Dependencies

- Supabase Auth for authentication
- Zod for form validation
- React Hook Form for form state management
- Next.js App Router for routing
- Shadcn UI components for UI elements

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up authentication context and provider
2. Create sign-up page and form
3. Create sign-in page and form
4. Implement password reset functionality
5. Add email verification handling
6. Set up protected routes with middleware
7. Implement error handling and success messages
8. Add remember me functionality
9. Test all authentication flows

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can successfully register with email and password
- Users receive an email verification link after registration
- Users can sign in with their credentials
- Users can request a password reset and set a new password
- Users are redirected to the dashboard after successful authentication
- Users cannot access protected routes without authentication
- Form validation prevents submission of invalid data
- Error messages are displayed for authentication failures
- Success messages are displayed for completed actions

## Timeline

- Estimated time for implementation: 3-4 days
- Key milestones:
  - Day 1: Set up auth context and sign-up page
  - Day 2: Implement sign-in and password reset
  - Day 3: Add email verification and protected routes
  - Day 4: Testing and refinement
